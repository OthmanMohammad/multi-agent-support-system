      "category": "billing",
      "content": "# Understanding ProjectFlow Plans\n\nProjectFlow offers four distinct pricing tiers designed to serve businesses at every stage of growth.\n\n## Free Plan\nThe Free plan is perfect for individuals and small teams just getting started with project management. It includes 3 user seats, 5 projects, and 100MB of storage. This plan gives you access to core features like task creation, basic team collaboration, and simple reporting. The Free plan is ideal for evaluating whether ProjectFlow is right for your organization before committing to a paid subscription.\n\n## Basic Plan\nAt $12 per user per month, the Basic plan is designed for small teams that need more resources than the Free tier. You get 10 projects, 5GB of storage, and access to time tracking functionality. The Basic plan also includes basic reporting capabilities and integrations with popular third-party tools like Slack and email. This plan works well for teams of 5-15 people who want structured project management without the premium features.\n\n## Premium Plan\nThe Premium plan ($24/user/month) removes most limitations and adds powerful advanced features. Enjoy unlimited projects, 50GB of storage, advanced analytics, automation rules, and custom integrations. The Premium plan includes our robust API access, priority email support, and integrations with Salesforce, GitHub, Jira, and more. This is ideal for growing teams that need sophisticated workflows and detailed insights.\n\n## Enterprise Plan\nOur Enterprise plan ($45/user/month, with volume discounts available) includes everything in Premium plus dedicated support, Single Sign-On (SSO), custom integrations, advanced security features, and SLA guarantees. Enterprise customers receive a dedicated account manager, custom training, and white-label options. Contact our sales team for a personalized quote.\n\n## Choosing the Right Plan\nStart by assessing your team size and project complexity. Most organizations grow from Free \u2192 Basic \u2192 Premium as their needs evolve. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time, with prorated billing applied to your next invoice.",

      "category": "billing",
      "content": "# Billing Cycles and Invoicing\n\n## Billing Cycle Basics\nProjectFlow offers two billing cycle options: monthly and annual. You choose your preference when setting up your subscription.\n\n### Monthly Billing\nWith monthly billing, you're charged on the same day each month for the upcoming month's service. This provides flexibility and allows you to adjust your team size or plan throughout the year. Monthly billing is perfect if you anticipate changes to your subscription.\n\n### Annual Billing\nAnnual billing provides a 15-20% discount compared to monthly pricing. You're charged once per year for 12 months of service. Annual billing is ideal if you have a stable team size and want to commit to ProjectFlow for a year.\n\n## Prorated Billing\nWhen you upgrade, downgrade, or change your seat count mid-cycle, we calculate a prorated amount. This is the difference between your old plan cost and new plan cost for the remaining days in your billing period. Prorated adjustments appear on your next invoice.\n\n## Invoices and Receipts\nInvoices are sent automatically on your billing date. You can also access all past invoices in your Billing section. Each invoice includes:\n- Invoice number and date\n- Your current plan and seat count\n- Itemized costs\n- Any credits or promotions applied\n- Payment method used\n- Due date (usually 30 days)\n\n## Managing Your Subscription\nYou can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your subscription anytime through your billing settings. Changes take effect on your next billing date unless you specify otherwise.",

      "category": "technical",
      "content": "# Resolving Sync Conflicts\n\nWhen you work on projects from multiple devices, occasionally sync conflicts can occur. Here's how to identify and resolve them.\n\n## What is a Sync Conflict?\nA sync conflict happens when the same project element (task, comment, file) is modified on different devices before they can synchronize. This creates two versions of the data that need to be reconciled.\n\n## How to Identify a Conflict\n- You see a \"Conflict Detected\" notification\n- A task or comment shows multiple versions\n- Your changes don't appear on other devices\n- You see a yellow warning banner on a task or project\n\n## Resolving Conflicts\n\n### Option 1: Keep Your Changes\nChoose to keep your local version. Tap \"Keep Mine\" and your version becomes the authoritative copy on all devices.\n\n### Option 2: Use the Server Version\nSelect \"Use Latest\" to accept the version saved on ProjectFlow's servers. This discards your local changes.\n\n### Option 3: Manual Merge\nFor complex conflicts, you can manually merge changes:\n1. Review both versions side-by-side\n2. Incorporate important changes from both\n3. Save the merged version\n4. Confirm the merge across devices\n\n## Prevention Tips\n- Keep your devices synced by checking ProjectFlow regularly\n- Avoid editing the same task simultaneously on multiple devices\n- Use the \"Lock Task\" feature when making significant changes\n- Enable \"Auto-sync\" in settings (recommended)\n\n## If Conflicts Persist\nForce a complete resync by:\n1. Go to Settings \u2192 Advanced\n2. Click \"Force Full Resync\"\n3. Wait for completion (may take several minutes)\n\nFor persistent issues, contact support@projectflow.com with a description of affected projects.",

      "category": "account",
      "content": "# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Setup\n\nTwo-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring both your password and a second verification method.\n\n## Why Use 2FA?\nEven if someone obtains your password, they can't access your account without the second authentication factor. This dramatically improves your account security.\n\n## Supported 2FA Methods\nProjectFlow supports three 2FA methods:\n1. **Authenticator App** (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator)\n2. **SMS Text Message**\n3. **Email Codes**\n\n## Setting Up 2FA\n\n### Step 1: Go to Security Settings\nLog in and navigate to Account Settings \u2192 Security. Click \"Enable Two-Factor Authentication\".\n\n### Step 2: Choose Your Method\n\n**Using an Authenticator App** (Recommended):\n1. Open your authenticator app\n2. Scan the QR code shown in ProjectFlow\n3. Your app generates a 6-digit code\n4. Enter the code to verify\n5. Save backup codes in a secure location\n\n**Using SMS**:\n1. Enter your phone number\n2. Receive a test code via SMS\n3. Enter the code to confirm\n4. Save backup codes\n\n**Using Email**:\n1. Confirm your email address\n2. Check your email for a code\n3. Enter the code to verify\n\n### Step 3: Save Backup Codes\nYou'll be given 10 backup codes. Each code can be used once if you lose access to your primary 2FA method. Store these securely (password manager, physical safe, etc.).\n\n## Using 2FA at Login\nWhen 2FA is enabled, you'll need to:\n1. Enter your email and password\n2. Enter your 6-digit code from your authenticator app, SMS, or email\n3. Gain access to your account\n\n## Losing Access to Your 2FA Device\nIf you lose your phone or no longer have access to your 2FA method:\n1. Use one of your backup codes during login\n2. If you've used all backup codes, contact support@projectflow.com\n3. We can disable 2FA after verifying your identity\n\n## Disabling 2FA\nTo disable 2FA, go to Settings \u2192 Security and click \"Disable 2FA\". You'll need to verify your identity.\n\n## Best Practices\n- Use an authenticator app instead of SMS (more secure)\n- Keep backup codes in a secure location\n- Don't share backup codes with anyone\n- Regenerate backup codes periodically\n- Test your 2FA method before relying on it\n\nFor questions about 2FA, contact support@projectflow.com.",

      "content": "# Driving ProjectFlow Adoption\n\nThe most successful ProjectFlow implementations have high team adoption. Here's how to ensure your team embraces the platform.\n\n## Pre-Launch Preparation\n\n### Define Your Workflow\nBefore launching ProjectFlow, decide:\n- What projects will you manage?\n- How will tasks be categorized?\n- What statuses do you need?\n- Who owns what?\n\nDocument this so team members understand the plan.\n\n### Choose a Champion\nDesignate someone on your team to be the ProjectFlow expert. They'll:\n- Lead rollout and training\n- Answer team questions\n- Provide feedback to management\n\n### Set Clear Expectations\nCommunicate to your team:\n- Why you're implementing ProjectFlow\n- How it will improve their work\n- When they need to start using it\n- Who to contact with questions\n\n## Launch Phase\n\n### Start with a Pilot\nLaunch with one team or department first. Use their feedback to refine your setup before rolling out enterprise-wide.\n\n### Provide Training\nDon't assume people will figure it out. Provide:\n- Recorded video training\n- Live group training sessions\n- One-on-one onboarding\n- Written documentation and guides\n\n### Migrate Initial Data\nHelp teams get their existing projects and tasks into ProjectFlow. This usually needs to be:\n- Manually migrated (for small amounts)\n- Imported via CSV (for bulk data)\n- Integrated from existing tools\n\n### Go Live\nPick a specific date for launch. Make it an event - send calendar invites, celebrate the launch, and be available for questions.\n\n## Post-Launch Success\n\n### Regular Check-ins\nWeek 1-2: Daily check-ins for issues and questions\nWeek 3-4: Weekly check-ins\nMonth 2+: Monthly pulse checks\n\n### Celebrate Wins\nShare adoption metrics and success stories. Recognize early adopters.\n\n### Gather Feedback\nAsk teams what's working and what could be better. Make quick improvements to increase adoption.\n\n### Address Resistance\nSome team members may resist change. Understand their concerns and show how ProjectFlow solves their pain points.\n\n### Optimize Workflows\nAs teams use ProjectFlow, refine processes:\n- Adjust status columns\n- Simplify custom fields\n- Automate common tasks\n- Integrate with other tools\n\n## Key Adoption Metrics\nTrack these to measure success:\n- % of team logging in daily\n- % of team with assigned tasks\n- # of comments per task\n- Time to complete tasks\n- User engagement over time\n\n## Common Adoption Mistakes\n- Launching too fast without proper training\n- Assuming people will adopt without encouragement\n- Not customizing for your specific workflow\n- Ignoring early feedback\n- Not providing ongoing support\n\n## Long-Term Adoption\nKeep adoption strong by:\n- Regularly highlighting new features\n- Sharing productivity insights\n- Celebrating team successes\n- Continuing to optimize workflows\n- Training new team members\n\nRemember: adoption is a journey, not a destination. Keep supporting your team and refining your implementation.\n\nNeed help with adoption? Our Customer Success team can provide guidance and training.",

Keep your key secret and never commit it to version control.\n\nInclude your API key in every request:\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\n```\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Resources\nThe API provides access to these core resources:\n- Projects\n- Tasks\n- Users\n- Teams\n- Comments\n- Time entries\n- Custom fields\n\n### REST Endpoints\nThe API follows RESTful conventions:\n- GET /projects - List projects\n- POST /projects - Create project\n- GET /projects/{id} - Get project details\n- PUT /projects/{id} - Update project\n- DELETE /projects/{id} - Delete project\n\n### Response Format\nAll responses are JSON. Successful requests return a 200-299 status with response body. Errors return 400+ status with error details.\n\n### Pagination\nList endpoints return 20 results by default. Use ?limit=50&offset=0 for pagination.\n\n## Authentication Methods\n\n### API Key (Recommended)\nSend in Authorization header:\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer sk_live_XXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n### OAuth 2.0\nFor applications that need user authorization:\n1. Redirect user to authorization endpoint\n2. User grants permission\n3. Receive authorization code\n4. Exchange code for access token\n5. Use token to make requests\n\n## Rate Limiting\nThe API enforces rate limits:\n- 1000 requests per minute per API key\n- Rate limit headers indicate remaining requests\n\nIf you exceed limits, requests return 429 status. Wait before retrying.\n\n## Example Request\n```\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY\" \\\n  https://api.projectflow.com/v1/projects\n```\n\n## SDKs\nWe provide official SDKs for:\n- Python\n- JavaScript/Node.js\n- Ruby\n- Go\n- Java\n\n## API Keys Management\nFrom Settings \u2192 API Keys:\n- Create multiple keys for different apps\n- Rotate keys regularly\n- Delete unused keys\n- Set IP restrictions\n- Monitor key usage\n\n## Error Handling\nAlways handle errors gracefully:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\n{\n  \"error\": \"invalid_request\",\n  \"message\": \"Missing required field: name\"\n}\n```\n\n## Support\nFor API questions:\n- Check the API docs\n- Review code examples\n- Contact api-support@projectflow.com\n\nGet started with the API today!",

You make API requests\n2. Your request count increments\n3. At the end of each minute, count resets\n4. Exceed the limit \u2192 429 status\n\n## Handling Rate Limits\n\n### Rate Limit Headers\nEvery response includes headers:\n```\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 1000\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 850\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1234567890\n```\n\nCheck these headers to track usage.\n\n### When You Hit the Limit\nYou'll receive:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests\nRetry-After: 60\n```\n\nWait the specified seconds before retrying.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Batch Operations\nInstead of many individual requests:\n```\n// Bad - 10 requests\nfor (let id of ids) {\n  GET /tasks/{id}\n}\n\n// Good - 1 request\nGET /tasks?ids=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n```\n\n### Caching\nCache responses to reduce requests:\n```\n// Cache project data for 1 hour\nconst cached = cache.get('projects');\nif (cached) return cached;\n```\n\n### Webhooks Over Polling\nUse webhooks instead of polling:\n```\n// Bad - poll every minute\nsetInterval(() => GET /projects, 60000)\n\n// Good - receive updates via webhook\nPOST /webhooks/projects/updated\n```\n\n### Pagination\nFetch results in batches:\n```\nGET /tasks?limit=100&offset=0\nGET /tasks?limit=100&offset=100\n```\n\n## Enterprise Rate Limits\nEnterprise customers can request higher limits based on needs:\n- Dedicated rate limit pool\n- Custom limits per endpoint\n- Burst allowance for spikes\n\nContact sales@projectflow.com to discuss enterprise limits.\n\n## Monitoring Usage\nTrack your API usage:\n- Settings \u2192 API Keys \u2192 View Usage\n- See requests per endpoint\n- Identify inefficient calls\n- Plan capacity\n\n## Increasing Limits\nFree/Basic accounts have standard limits. Upgrade to Premium or Enterprise for higher limits.\n\n## Support\nQuestions about rate limiting?\n- Check error messages for guidance\n- Review API docs\n- Contact api-support@projectflow.com\n\nBuild better integrations with smart API usage!",
